## Spatial and molecular anatomy of germ layers in the gastrulating Cynomolgus monkey embryo

We performed serial sections of cynomolgus monkeys (*Macaca fascicularis*) gastrulating embryos at 1-day temporal resolution and reconstructed three-dimensional digital models based on high-resolution anatomical atlas that revealed the dynamic changes in the geography of the mesoderm and primitive streaks. Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles that correspond to distinct germ layers and cross-species spatiotemporal transcriptome analysis revealed a developmental coordinate of germ layer segregation between mouse and primate. Furthermore, we identified a cross-species transcription factor during gastrulation indicating species-specific differences. These results offer new insights into evolutionary conserved and divergent processes during mammalian gastrulation.

## Highlight
* A high-resolution anatomical atlas of Cynomolgus gastrulation embryos 
* Created a three-dimensional digital model set from five stages serial sections
* Profiled spatiotemporal gene expression patterns in monkey gastrulation
* Cross-species comparison infers conservation of functional attributes of regulome and signaling activity in germ layer formation
